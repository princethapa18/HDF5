Convert a ".pc" (Pamcrash geometry text file) into my own hdf5 format file i.e ".myh5" file.
Create a small application to read ".pc" file and convert that into ".myh5" file.
And it should also be able to read ".myh5" file.

Extension would be to show the geometry using opengl (Bigger task. Maybe Later)

HDF5 (Heirarchical Data Format version 5) 
Data is stored in tree structure.
3 types
groups
datasets
fields

".pc" is a Pamcrash geometry model file:
It consists of several parts 
and each part has elements and 
each element has nodes.


Requirements:
C++, C
HDF5 viewer to view ".myh5" file
HDF5 C++ functions to create/access datasets, groups and fields.
